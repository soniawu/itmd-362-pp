# Production Problem 08: Emotional Design Hunt

## The Problem

First, read the assigned reading from Donald Norman, listed on the ITMD 362 syllabus.

Then, locate a physical object that you use regularly in your life (does not have to be an electronic or digital object), take a photograph of it, and identify in a sentence or two its visceral, behavioral, and reflective levels of emotional design. Then, develop a list of three qualities in that objectâ€™s emotional design that your group might use in your MyIIT redesign project. Be sure to share these with your group.

## Deliverables

A. Photograph of the object (place in the pp-09/ directory and commit).

B. Emotional design levels of your object:

* Visceral: I had no plan to buy a mug when I was shopping on that day. The mug caught my attention because the beautiful print and the unique design of the lid. (see mug1)

* Behavioral: More important than the unusual look, the lid gave me warmness. In winter, my tea would get cold in couple minutes. With the lid, I can keep it warm longer.

* Reflective: We love to make tea with loose tea leaves. Usually we use a filter to separate the leaves. All the filter we got are made of metals. Some would be rusted after a while. The filter came with the mug is ceramic, perfectly fit in the mug. Until this point, I had no hesitation to get the mug on my shoping cart. (see mug2)

C.  Emotional design qualities of the object that might be useful for Project 2 MyIIT redesign:

1. Attrct user's eye first
2. Show information that user can get what they are interested
3. Clearly understand what your user's ability to use your site. Give clear instruction to lead user to achieve their goal.
