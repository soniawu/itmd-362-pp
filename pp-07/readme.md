# Production Problem 07: Implementing HCI guidelines for touchscreens

## The Problem

Using the HCI guidelines from either Apple/iOS, GNOME, or Windows, redesign the login page at
http://my.iit.edu/ for a touch-friendly environment. Use this to kickstart your work on Project 2.

**You only need to sketch your redesign**, and in the text below, reference at least three different
points of guidance from chosen HCI guidelines that went into your redesign sketches (you might
want to do multiple sketches, each highlighting a different feature of the same overall design).

## Resources

* Apple iOS HCI Guidlines:
  https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/overview/design-principles/
* Gnome Desktop:
  https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/design
* Windows Desktop Guidelines:
  https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/design

## Deliverables

Small commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1) photographs of sketches of your new design, from your sketchbook
2) an explanation of three different points of guidance from your chosen guidelines (point to the
   specific URL where the guidance can be found) that you implemented in your sketch, written below:

* HCI Guidline One (URL): https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/overview/design-principles/
* How you implemented it in your sketch: Clarity. This is a login page. The login box is at the center on both mobile and desktop. It clearly tells uer this is the myIIT login page 

* HCI Guidline Two (URL): https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/overview/design-principles/
* How you implemented it in your sketch: User Control. User may just want to get non-personal information, like school calendar, news etc..  The page provide links to access a few common, public information. If user find what the need, they don't have to login.

* HCI Guidline Three (URL): https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/design
* How you implemented it in your sketch: Message. Page will post error message when user name or password found problem and provide a link to help user to resolve such problem.
